# Amazon Book Finder

Amazon Book Finder is a Ruby file that finds amazon pages from a given list of ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 (in .csv or .txt files), retrieves current price and availability and stores information to an output file.

## Future Developments

Add methods to scrape ISBNs from another publishers website and export to book_files folder for amazon_book_finder to use
